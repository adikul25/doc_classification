# Document Classification

This repository contains code and resources for document classification using machine learning techniques.

## Description

The project aims to classify documents into predefined categories using machine learning algorithms. The primary language used in this repository is Jupyter Notebook, which provides an interactive environment for developing and testing the classification models.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/adikul25/doc_classification.git
    cd doc_classification
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the notebooks and perform document classification, follow these steps:

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Open the desired notebook** and follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
